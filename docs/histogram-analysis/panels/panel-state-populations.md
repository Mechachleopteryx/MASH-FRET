### Method panel

Population calculation settings.

* <u>Population calculation method</u>

* <u>Data bootstrapping</u>


### Thresholding panel

States are separated by fixed thresholds, histogram counts are summed up between thresholds and resulting populations are normalized.

* Set `J-1` thresholds in edit fieldd **(1)** for a model containing *J* of states.
* Select threshold with dropdown menu **(2)** and set the threshold value in edit field **(3)**.
* Start calculations with button ![Start](../../assets/images/but-HA-start.png)
