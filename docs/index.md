## What is MASH-FRET?
MASH-FRET is a **Matlab**-based software package for the analysis of **single-molecule FRET videos and trajectories** developed in the group of [Prof. Roland Sigel](https://www.chem.uzh.ch/en/sigel/news.html) at the University of Zurich.
The framework encompasses the entire workflow from spot detection and trace processing to histogram and dwell time analysis.

The program is structured in five modules:

- [Simulation](docs/simulation)
- [Video processing](docs/movie-processing)
- [Trace processing](docs/trace-processing)
- [Histogram analysis](docs/histogram-analysis)
- [Transition analysis](docs/transition-analysis)
