The module Transition analysis is the fifth and last component of the software MASH-FRET and can be selected in the main 
[tool bar](../../Getting_started.html#interface).

The interface can be divided into several subunits that respectively allow to:
* <u>browse and process</u> imported data
* <u>analyze</u> transition data
* <u>visualize</u> the calculated data
* <u>control</u> action logs

Learn about individual components of the interface at 
[Transition analysis panels](/docs/transition-analysis/panels).
