# Simulation interface
{: .no_toc }

The module Simulation is the first component of the software MASH-FRET and can be selected in the main 
[tool bar](../Getting_started.html#interface).

The interface is divided into three subunits that respectively allow to:
* <u>generate</u> data
* <u>visualize</u> the generated data
* <u>export</u> the generated data

Learn about individual components of the interface in the 
[Panels](panels.html) section.
