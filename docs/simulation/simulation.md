# Simulation
{: .no_toc }

Use this module to  **generatesynthetic data** (single molecule videos and trajectories).

Simulation framework is limited to:
- <u>surface-immobilized</u> molecules,
- <u>two</u> spectroscopic channels (one donor and one acceptor), 
- <u>continuous wavelength</u> excitation (no ALEX).
