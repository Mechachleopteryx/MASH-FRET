# Use Trace manager - Interface
{: .no_toc }

The trace manager allows to visualize data of all single molecules in the project, and is used to sort molecules into sub-groups and/or exclude irrelevant traces from the set.
Trace manager is accessed by pressing 
![TM](../../assets/images/gui/TP-but-tm.png "TM") in the 
[Sample management](../panels/panel-sample-management.html#trace-manager) panel of module Trace processing.
