# Bin trajectories
{: .no_toc }

Binning trajectories in time can be used to merge projects with different recording rates or to artificially change experimental conditions.
The binning process is performed on ASCII traces and by using MATLAB's command window.
To bin trajectories, follow the procedure described below.

## Procedure
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

1. TOC

**Note:** *As binned trajectories and the initial single molecule video are desynchronized, the binning process induces a loss of video data.
Therefore, it is recommended to perform all adjustments of molecule positions and background corrections prior binning.*
