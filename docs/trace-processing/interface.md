# Trace processing interface
{: .no_toc }

Trace processing is the third module of MASH-FRET and is accessed by pressing 
![Trace processing](../assets/images/gui/TP-but-trace-processing.png "Trace processing") in the main 
[tool bar](../Getting_started.html#interface).

The interface can be divided into three subunits that respectively allow to:
* <u>import</u> and <u>export</u> data
* <u>process</u> time traces
* <u>visualize</u> trace processing

[Panels](panels.html) section.
