## Molecule list

Use this list to navigate through the single molecules in your sample.

Molecules in your project are listed in **(a)**.
Selection in the list updates the 
[Visualization area](area-visualization.html) and adapt the processing parameters of panels 
[Sub-images and background correction](panel-subimage-background-correction), 
[Dwell-time processing](panel-dwelltime-processing), 
[Factor corrections](panel-factor-corrections), 
[Photobleaching](panel-photobleaching) and 
[Denoising](panel-denoising) to the selected molecule.
To navigate through the molecules in your sample, simply select the corresponding index in the list or press 
![left arrow button](../../assets/images/gui/TP-but-arrow-left.png) and 
![right arrow button](../../assets/images/gui/TP-but-arrow-right.png) to go to the previous and next molecule respectively.

## Molecule status

The molecule status is defined by the inclusion/exclusion from the sample and the label.
