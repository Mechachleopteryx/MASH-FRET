Follow this procedure to determine the optimal methods and method parameters to analyse your data.

**Note:** *Step 1 is optional and concerns only the case where an algorithm is tested and optimized for particular experimental data*

{% include tutorial_head.html %}

In this step, relevant parameters are collected or calculated from the previous experimental data processing and analysis.
