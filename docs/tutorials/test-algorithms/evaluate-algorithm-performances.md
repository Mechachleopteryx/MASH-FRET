Follow this procedure to determine the optimal methods and method parameters to analyse your data.

**Note:** *Step 1 is optional and concerns only the case where an algorithm is tested and optimized for particular experimental data*

{% include tutorial_head.html %}

In this step, processing and/or analysis results are compared to parameters used for simulation and algorithm's performances are characterized.
